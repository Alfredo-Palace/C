# PI (INTEGRATING PROJECT) 🖥️
# "CURP CALCULATOR" 🧮
## Synopsis :mexico:
In Mexico, the Unique Population Registration Code (CURP) is a unique 18-character alphanumeric identity code used to officially identify Mexican residents and citizens throughout the country.

The reasons for the development of this project are simply because it caught my attention that this code is extremely important in procedures here in Mexico and I am amazed at the way the government labels us by means of codes. Also among the reasons for the development are to use the greatest amount of knowledge learned throughout the learning unit of the structured programming subject

## Purpouse of the program 🥅
This program is designed to give you your CURP in a simulated way, The program mostly uses arrays, pointers, memory access, database, and strings.

## Build instructions 📓
- Just copy the code of the file CurpCalculator.c in your trusted compiler and give it the same name as the file.
- Then create another document and name top.h and paste the code that appears in this folder with the same name
- Now just compile or run the code
## To acces to the files 🖱️
- [CurpCalculator.c](https://github.com/Alfredo-Palace/C/blob/main/PIA/CurpCalculator.c).
- [top.h](https://github.com/Alfredo-Palace/C/blob/main/PIA/top.h).
## To understand how can you get a CURP manually 👨‍🏫
see this link: [CURP presentation](https://github.com/Alfredo-Palace/C/blob/main/PIA/Presentacion%20CURP.pdf).

## General program logistics 🎂
To get the CURP you need to get information 5 differente kind information from yourself: 
- Full name 
- Birthday 
- Gender 
- Place of birt
- Random numbers

From establishing this, subroutines were designed to obtain the key data of these 5 blocks and they were joined in a main function.

Memories and a robust interface were also added so that the program works in a good way

## What does the program need to give you your CURP? 💻
1. The program will first ask you for your name which must begin with your surname and end with your name (s)
2. Then the program will require your date of birth in the format YYYY-MM-DD
3. To continue the program, your gender will be asked if you identify as a woman you will place an M and if you identify as a man you will place an H
4. Almost at the end of the program, it will give you a menu of 33 options with the states of Mexico and an option for those born abroad, just enter the number according to the menu of the place where you were born. 
5. At the end the program assigns you a random Homoclave and with it your CURP

** WARNING ** You must fill in the information as requested in the program because if you put something wrong it is possible that the program will tell you the error or expel you from the code
